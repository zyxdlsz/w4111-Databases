    "\"Data integrity is normally enforced in a database system by a series of integrity constraints or rules. Three types of integrity constraints are an inherent part of the relational data model: _entity integrity, referential integrity and domain integrity:_\n",
    "- __Entity integrity__ concerns the concept of a primary key. Entity integrity is an integrity rule which states that every table must have a primary key and that the column or columns chosen to be the primary key should be unique and not null.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Referential integrity__ concerns the concept of a foreign key. The referential integrity rule states that any foreign-key value can only be in one of two states. The usual state of affairs is that the foreign-key value refers to a primary key value of some table in the database. Occasionally, and this will depend on the rules of the data owner, a foreign-key value can be null. In this case, we are explicitly saying that either there is no relationship between the objects represented in the database or that this relationship is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Domain integrity__ specifies that all columns in a relational database must be declared upon a defined domain. The primary unit of data in the relational data model is the data item. Such data items are said to be <span style=\"color: red;\">non-decomposable or atomic.</span> A domain is a set of values of the same type. Domains are therefore pools of values from which actual values appearing in the columns of a table are drawn.\n",

    "__Common Integrity Constrains:__\n",
    "- NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value\n",

    "- PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table\n",
    "- FOREIGN KEY - Uniquely identifies a row/record in another table\n",
    "- CHECK - Ensures that all values in a column satisfies a specific condition\n",
