    "\"In the context of relational databases, a foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table or the same table. In simpler words, the foreign key is defined in a second table, but it refers to the primary key or a unique key in the first table.\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key)\n",

    "1. Foreign keys implement _Integrity Constraint,_ which we will cover later. A tuple in one table can exists only if the foreign key matches a primary key in another table.\n",
    "2. Foreign keys define _Relationships._ I can use a foreign key to find tuples in two different tables that are related.\n",
