    "### Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "- A core concept in Python, and by extension PyCharm and any Python tool, is a virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"'What Is a Virtual Environment?'\"<br><br>\n",
    "At its core, the main purpose of Python virtual environments is to create an isolated environment for Python projects. This means that each project can have its own dependencies, regardless of what dependencies every other project has.\" (https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- [From the Python documentation:](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Python applications will often use packages and modules that don’t come as part of the standard library. Applications will sometimes need a specific version of a library, because the application may require that a particular bug has been fixed or the application may be written using an obsolete version of the library’s interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means it may not be possible for one Python installation to meet the requirements of every application. If application A needs version 1.0 of a particular module but application B needs version 2.0, then the requirements are in conflict and installing either version 1.0 or 2.0 will leave one application unable to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution for this problem is to create a virtual environment, a self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different applications can then use different virtual environments. To resolve the earlier example of conflicting requirements, application A can have its own virtual environment with version 1.0 installed while application B has another virtual environment with version 2.0. If application B requires a library be upgraded to version 3.0, this will not affect application A’s environment.\"\n",

    "## The Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- Almost all database engines and models have the concepts of\n",
    "    - Objects that are some form of array of (name, value) pairs.\n",
    "    - Sets of similar or related objects.\n",
    "    - Four basic (CRUD) operations on a set\n",
    "        - CREATE a new object and add to a set.\n",
    "        - RETRIEVE an object in a set based on a criteria.\n",
    "        - UPDATE an object in a set, e.g. change the data in the object.\n",
    "        - DELETE an object from a set, specifying the object(s) by some criteria.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "- In the file systems/CSV model:\n",
    "    - A set is a file, e.g. People.csv.\n",
    "    - Each object is a row in the file.\n",
    "    - The header row gives the names of each column.\n",
    "    - The CRUD processing involves writing a program that reads the file, changes the two-dimensional array and writing the file.\n",
    "        - CREATE: Append a row and save the file.\n",
    "        - RETRIEVE: Scan the table and apply some kind of IF statement.\n",
    "        - UPDATE: Change a row in the two dimensional array.\n",
    "        - DELETE: Remove a row from the array.\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "- In the \"pure\" relational model\n",
    "    - A set is a _relation_.\n",
    "    - An object is a _row_ or _tuple_.\n",
    "    - The operation for _retrieve_ is $\\sigma$.\n",
    "    - There is no support for CREATE, UPDATE or DELETE.\n",
    "    - There is an _algebra_ and language for producing a new relation from existing relations that you can use to \"sort of\" implement INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- In SQL,\n",
    "    - A set is a _table_.\n",
    "    - An object is a _row_ or _tuple_.\n",
    "    - INSERT is the create operation.\n",
    "    - UPDATE is the delete operation.\n",
    "    - DELETE is the delete operation.\n",
    "    - SELECT is the statement that realizes the relational _algebra_.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- In [Representational state transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) REST.\n",
    "    - A set is a _resource_ that is a collection of _resources._\n",
    "    - An object is a resource.\n",
    "    - CREATE is HTTP POST\n",
    "    - RETRIEVE is HTTP GET\n",
    "    - UPDATE is HTTP PUT (or PATCH)\n",
    "    - DELETE is HTTP DELETE.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- [Redis](https://redis.io/): I am tempted to say, \"Don't ask!\"\n",
    "    - The basic concept is that Redis stores pairs of (key, value).\n",
    "    - Key is just a string\n",
    "    - Value can be:\n",
    "        - String\n",
    "        - List\n",
    "        - Hash\n",
    "        - Set\n",
    "        - Sorted Set\n",
    "    - The CRUD commands depend on the data type for a value.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- In [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/): I am tempted to say, \"No. Seriously, do not ask! Please!\"\n",
    "    - CouchDB is basically a REST/HTTP accessible document database.\n",
    "    - The CRUD operations are the same as for basic REST, but ...\n",

    "\n",
    "- Briefly discussed the concept in lecture 1, and will cover in more detail now.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are several types of keys:\n",
    "    - Super key: A set of attributes within a table whose values can be used to uniquely identify a tuple. \n",
    "    - Candidate key: A minimal super key. That is, no subset of the columns is a super key.\n",
    "    - Primary key: Candidate key arbitrarily chosen to be the \"primary\" key.\n",
    "    - Alternate key: Alternate key is the key that can work as a primary key. Basically it is a candidate key that currently is not primary key.\n",
    "    - Composite/Compound key: Composite Key is a combination of more than one fields/columns of a table. It can be a Candidate key, Primary key.\n",
    "    - Unique Key: Unique key is a set of one or more fields/columns of a table that uniquely identify a record in database table but can be NULL.\n",
    "    - Foreign key: Foreign key is a a set of columns in database table that is primary key in another table. It can accept multiple null, duplicate values.\n",
    "    - Natural key: A natural key (also known as business key) is a type of unique key, found in relational model database design, that is formed of attributes that already exist in the real world. It is used in business-related columns. In other words, a natural key is a candidate key that has a logical relationship to the attributes within that row. A natural key is sometimes called domain key. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate_key)\n",
    "    - Surrogate key: A surrogate key (or synthetic key, entity identifier, system-generated key, database sequence number, factless key, technical key, or arbitrary unique identifier) in a database is a unique identifier for either an entity in the modeled world or an object in the database. The surrogate key is not derived from application data, unlike a natural (or business) key which is derived from application data. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_key)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"In the relational model of databases, a primary key is a specific choice of a minimal set of attributes (columns) that uniquely specify a tuple (row) in a relation (table). Informally, a primary key is 'which attributes identify a record', and in simple cases are simply a single attribute: a unique id. More formally, a primary key is a choice of candidate key (a minimal superkey); any other candidate key is an alternate key.<br><br>\n",
    "A primary key may consist of real-world observables, in which case it is called a natural key, while an attribute created to function as a key is called a surrogate key. For example, for a database of people (of a given nationality), time and location of birth is a natural key, while national identification numbers are surrogate keys.\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_key)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Note:__\n",
    "    - Time and location of birth is a terrible natural key.\n",
    "    - A better example is ```Appearances``` in Lahman database, the columns: ```playerID, teamID, yearID``` uniquely identify a tuple.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- For now, just think:\n",
    "    - Every table should have a primary key.\n",
    "    - Put indexes on other columns or sets of columns that will frequently be in WHERE clauses.\n",
