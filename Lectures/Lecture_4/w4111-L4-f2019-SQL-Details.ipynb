    " \n",
    "\n",
    "- One classification approach:\n",
    "    - <span style=\"color: red;\"> _Real-time (online) systems,_ where you submit requests to do a small amount of work that has to be done before some very early deadline, or interactively why the user waits.</span>\n",
    "    - _Batch processing systems,_ where you submit a a bunch of files, a \"job\" containing multiple subprograms, and later receive output in the form of a file.\n",
    "    - _Data warehouse systems,_ where reporting programs and ad hoc queries access data that is integrated from multiple data sources.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- Real-time (online) system:\n",
    "    - Most familiar is interactive web applications, e.g. CourseWorks, online banking.\n",

    "\n",
    "- A data processing system may involve some combination of the following functions\n",
    "    - Conversion - converting data to another format.\n",

    "    - Sorting – \"arranging items in some sequence and/or in different sets.\"\n",
    "    - Summarization – reducing detail data to its main points.\n",
    "    - Aggregation – combining multiple pieces of data.\n",
    "    - Analysis – the \"collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data.\".\n",
    "    - Reporting – list detail or summary data or computed information.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Both SQL/online and batch/MaoReduce/Hadoop have operators/steps implementing the functions. For example,\n",

In this case, we refer to these resources as singleton resources. Collections are themselves resources as well.\n",

    "<span style=\"color:red\"><strong>Reminder: I let you cut and paste code to save typing. That means I get to cut and paste text to save typing.</strong></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "From [Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codd%27s_12_rules)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Codd's twelve rules are a set of thirteen rules (numbered zero to twelve) proposed by Edgar F. Codd, a pioneer of the relational model for databases, designed to define what is required from a database management system in order for it to be considered relational, i.e., a relational database management system (RDBMS)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Rule 0 $-$ The foundation rule:__ For any system that is advertised as, or claimed to be, a relational data base management system, that system must be able to manage data bases entirely through its relational capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Rule 1 $-$ The information rule:__ All information in a relational data base is represented explicitly at the logical level and in exactly one way – by values in tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Rule 2 $-$ The guaranteed access rule:__ Each and every datum (atomic value) in a relational data base is guaranteed to be logically accessible by resorting to a combination of table name, primary key value and column name.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Rule 3 $-$ Systematic treatment of null values:__ Null values (distinct from the empty character string or a string of blank characters and distinct from zero or any other number) are supported in fully relational DBMS for representing missing information and inapplicable information in a systematic way, independent of data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Rule 4 $-$ Dynamic online catalog based on the relational model:__ The data base description is represented at the logical level in the same way as ordinary data, so that authorized users can apply the same relational language to its interrogation as they apply to the regular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Rule 5 $-$ The comprehensive data sublanguage rule:__ A relational system may support several languages and various modes of terminal use (for example, the fill-in-the-blanks mode). However, there must be at least one language whose statements are expressible, per some well-defined syntax, as character strings and that is comprehensive in supporting all of the following items:\n",
    "    - Data definition.\n",
    "    - View definition.\n",
    "    - Data manipulation (interactive and by program).\n",
    "    - Integrity constraints.\n",
    "    - Authorization.\n",
    "    - Transaction boundaries (begin, commit and rollback).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Rule 6 $-$ The view updating rule:__ All views that are theoretically updatable are also updatable by the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Rule 7 $-$ Possible for High-level insert, update, and delete:__ The capability of handling a base relation or a derived relation as a single operand applies not only to the retrieval of data but also to the insertion, update and deletion of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Rule 8 $-$ Physical data independence:__ Application programs and terminal activities remain logically unimpaired whenever any changes are made in either storage representations or access methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Rule  $-$ Logical data independence:__ Application programs and terminal activities remain logically unimpaired when information-preserving changes of any kind that theoretically permit unimpairment are made to the base tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Rule 10 $-$ Integrity independence:__ Integrity constraints specific to a particular relational data base must be definable in the relational data sublanguage and storable in the catalog, not in the application programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Rule 11 $-$ Distribution independence:__ The end-user must not be able to see that the data is distributed over various locations. Users should always get the impression that the data is located at one site only.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Rule 12 $-$ The nonsubversion rule:__ If a relational system has a low-level (single-record-at-a-time) language, that low level cannot be used to subvert or bypass the integrity rules and constraints expressed in the higher level relational language (multiple-records-at-a-time).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- This lecture will introduce and focus on some realizations of these rules, specifically:\n",
    "    - Information Rule\n",
    "    - Null\n",
    "    - Integrity"

The usual state of affairs is that the foreign-key value refers to a primary key value of some table in the database. Occasionally, and this will depend on the rules of the data owner, a foreign-key value can be null.

Domains are therefore pools of values from which actual values appearing in the columns of a table are drawn.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"A check constraint is a type of integrity constraint in SQL which specifies a requirement that must be met by each row in a database table. The constraint must be a predicate. It can refer to a single column, or multiple columns of the table. The result of the predicate can be either TRUE, FALSE, or UNKNOWN, depending on the presence of NULLs. If the predicate evaluates to UNKNOWN, then the constraint is not violated and the row can be inserted or updated in the table. This is contrary to predicates in WHERE clauses in SELECT or UPDATE statements.\"\n",
