    "##### Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "- Metadata is \"data information that provides information about other data\". Three distinct types of metadata exist:\n",
    "    1. Descriptive metadata\n",
    "    2. Structural metadata\n",
    "    3. Administrative metadata.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Descriptive metadata describes a resource for purposes such as discovery and identification. It can include elements such as title, abstract, author, and keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Structural metadata is metadata about containers of data and indicates how compound objects are put together, for example, how pages are ordered to form chapters. It describes the types, versions, relationships and other characteristics of digital materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Administrative metadata provides information to help manage a resource, such as when and how it was created, file type and other technical information, and who can access it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will cover metadata, especially while studying relational data.\n",

It is particularly useful in handling structured data where there are relations between different entities/variables of the data. SQL offers two main advantages over older read/write APIs ... ... First, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command; and second, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g. with or without an index.\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "- Different database management systems have different APIs and connection libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The schema (columns, types, etc) of a database evolves and changes as applications evolve and change.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The choice of a database management system for an application may change over time as requirements change.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A well designed application _encapsulates_ the access to a persistent data type into a single module/object: a data access object]:(https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/data_access_object_pattern)\n",
    "    - All application logic in all modules, functions, classes uses methods on the data access object.\n",
    "    - Code changes due to changes in the choice of DBMS, different APIs to DBMS, schema changes, etc. occur in the DAO, preventing the need to change dozens of functions, classes, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- This is an example of a [software design pattern:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) \"In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem (... ...) in software design. (... ...) It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are many different versions and names for the data access object design pattern.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- HW1 implements a very simple implementation of the concept. We will demonstrate writing a single set of application functions that can access data in a CSV file or an RDB table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The level of programming skill necessary to solve the HW is what you learned in 1004, 1006 or 1007.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some of the course TAs who are not CS majors can tell you value of learning some of the concepts in the classes homeworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get very simple experience with the concept of design patterns. The concept is useful, recurring and cool to talk about on internship interviews.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "2. Understand the value of using a DBMS and how they simplify working with data compared to just programming to files.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "3. Begin to understand the architecture and implementation of DBMS, which we cover in module II.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "4. Develop basic skills for importing raw data into DBMS for analysis."
