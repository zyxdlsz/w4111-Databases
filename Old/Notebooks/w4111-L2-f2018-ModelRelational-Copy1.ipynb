    "- This is an _introduction_ to databases. I want to cover\n",
    "    - Several types of data models, and the database systems that implement the models.\n",
    "    - Best practices for modeling and implementing data-centric solutions.\n",
    "    - Different types of application scenarios that rely on databases.\n",
    "    - Interesting topics and challenges in the design and implementation of database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are several (too many) ways to classify applications and scenarios that use databases. Some examples\n",
    "    - One classification approach\n",
    "        - _Batch processing systems,_ where you submit a a bunch of files, a \"job\" containing multiple subprograms, and later receive output in the form of a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - <span style=\"color: red;\"> _Real-time (online) systems,_ where you submit requests to do a small amount of work that has to be done before some very early deadline, or interactively why the user waits.</span>\n",
    "        - _Data warehouse systems,_ where reporting programs and ad hoc queries access data that is integrated from multiple data sources\n",
    "    - Annother classification approach: A data processing system may involve some combination of\n",
    "        - Conversion converting data to another format.\n",
    "        - Validation – Ensuring that supplied data is \"clean, correct and useful.\"\n",
    "        - Sorting – \"arranging items in some sequence and/or in different sets.\"\n",
    "        - Summarization – reducing detail data to its main points.\n",
    "        - Aggregation – combining multiple pieces of data.\n",
    "        - Analysis – the \"collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data.\".\n",
    "        - Reporting – list detail or summary data or computed information.\n",
    "    - A third classification approach\n",

    "        - <span style=\"color: red;\">External Database</span>\n",

The operation with respect to which a group is defined is often called the \"group operation,\" and a set is said to be a group \"under\" this operation. Elements A, B, C, ... with binary operation between A and B denoted AB form a group if\n",
